Daily planner ReadMe

In this website I am using JS to dynamically create timeblocks.

This website is also using Jquery and bootstrap to help with all the coding.

I also included my own css so I wasn't stuck with just the styles from bootstrap.

I also included a script JS to keep everything nicer and organized
